# Stroma_supported_tumor_growth
Attached codes process tumor volume data, 
fit models to data by minimizing the sum of squared errors, 
and compare models using the Akaike information criterion.
Data used in this project is avaialable on request from the sources cited in "A Mathematical Model of Stroma-Supported Allometric Tumor Growth."
